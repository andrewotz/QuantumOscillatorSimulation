Overview
This project provides an interactive visualization of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) — a foundational concept in quantum mechanics describing a particle bound in a harmonic potential, like a mass on a spring at the quantum scale.
Using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and interactive sliders (ipywidgets), this simulation lets you explore:

The wavefunction for different quantum energy levels (n),
The corresponding probability density (chance of finding the particle at a position),
The potential energy well the particle experiences,
And the quantized energy levels associated with each quantum state.

What is the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator?
The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator models a particle confined in a parabolic potential well — the quantum version of a classical mass on a spring. Unlike classical physics, where energy can vary continuously, the quantum system can only have specific discrete energy levels (quantized).

Why is this important?
It’s one of the few quantum systems with exact analytical solutions.
It forms the basis for understanding molecular vibrations, quantum fields, and even some quantum computing concepts.
Many complex quantum systems approximate harmonic oscillators near equilibrium points.

What does this project show?
1.) Wavefunction ψ(sub n)(x): The quantum state’s spatial probability amplitude. It’s a complex shape that oscillates more as the quantum number 
n increases.
2.) Probability Density (ψ(sub n)(x))^2: The squared wavefunction shows the likelihood of finding the particle at position 
x. Peaks indicate more probable locations.
3.) Potential Energy V(x): The parabolic "bowl" that confines the particle.
4.) Energy Level E(sub n): The fixed energy value corresponding to the quantum number 
n. Each level is higher than the last by fixed quanta of energy.

How does it work?
The wavefunctions are constructed using Hermite polynomials, mathematical functions describing oscillations with increasing complexity for higher 
n.
The Gaussian term accounts for quantum localization — the particle isn’t found everywhere, just mostly near the bottom of the potential.
The interactive sliders let you change:
The quantum number n, moving through the discrete energy states.
The width of the spatial domain for the plot, helping zoom in or out on the wavefunction shapes.

Why this project is cool and useful
Educational: It visually conveys the abstract concept of quantum states and energy quantization.
Interactive: The sliders give hands-on experience with quantum behavior rather than static textbook images.
Scientific foundation: The code uses fundamental quantum mechanics formulas and recursion for Hermite polynomials.
Flexible: Easy to extend for other potentials, particle masses, or quantum phenomena.
Great for demos: Ideal for teaching quantum mechanics in classrooms or explaining quantum ideas to curious learners.

How to run
Install required Python packages:
pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python environment that supports widgets (e.g., JupyterLab).
Use the sliders to explore wavefunctions for quantum numbers from 0 to 10 and adjust the plot width.

Technical Details
Uses natural units reduced with reduced Plank's constant h = 1, particle mass m = 1, and angular frequency w = 1 for simplicity.
Implements Hermite polynomials recursively for efficient computation.
Probability density calculated by squaring the wavefunction’s magnitude.
Energy levels follow E(sub n)  = hw(n + 1/2), showing quantized steps.

Future ideas
Add time evolution animation of wavefunctions.
Explore other quantum potentials (e.g., finite wells, double wells).
Include 3D visualization of quantum states.
Integrate explanations of uncertainty principle and tunneling.

Summary
This Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Visualizer project transforms complex quantum mechanics math into an engaging, interactive tool. Whether you’re a student, educator, or curious programmer, it’s a fantastic way to deepen your understanding of quantum behavior and visualize the strange, beautiful world of quantum states.
